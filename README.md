# Introduction

Hi again!

The previous project delved into our world population, so this time around, I thought about our happiness. Especially since we have found ourselves embroiled in the mayhem of the pandemic since end 2019 onwards, I wondered about how people assessed their level of happiness during these exceptionally challenging times. This was only made possible thanks to the folks who tenaciously complied the 2021 edition of the World Happiness Report (WHR). Do check our their [vibrant website](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/) for their much more in-depth study.

The dataset was comprehensive enough, but I wanted to include the region names of the respective countries. To incorporate this variable, I used Python to do a Vlookup-function-equivalent. The Jupyter notebook that has details on how this was done, plus the minor data transformation that I did to polish up the dataset a wee bit more, is available in this repository.

Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio helped me to gain some insights to what people's perceptions of their outlooks in lives. I have to admit that I did have quite a bit of fun playing around with the SQL queries, which could possibly explain why it is much more extensive than usual. Afterwhich, I used Tableau Public to create the visuals. In order to avoid cluttering with too many bars and charts, I decided to keep the dashboard easy to the eyes by only highlighting the big picture from the global and regional perspectives. Tableau Public was my visualisation tool of choice for this exercise.

Here is a little glimpse to what the final dashboard looks like.



The interactive form could be accessed via this [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/OurHappiness/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). Additionally, the SQL query file and Tableau workbook are found in this repository as well.

Thank you for taking the time to know more about my work. This project is dedicated to anyone and everyone who makes it their endless mission to seek for happiness. I hope that you will find what you are looking for. :)
